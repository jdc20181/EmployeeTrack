#Security in Employee Track

I have decided to use a different method of storing data vs a traditional database. 




> It is important to block access to program files, and data folders on your computer. 


This not only secures EmployeeTrack, it also prevents accidental data loss. 

> Do not use easy passwords

I have set up the password and username to be Very effecient and secure. They are not accessible by the naked eye, but can be easily entered by a guess. 
Since this is a Off-Line based program - There is no way at this time to reset or lock out users who try to get past the security (password protected)


*More Security information will be added when needed.*
