#First Time Installation 

You need to:

  - Setup Your Admin Account
  
  - Enable Your Premium License (Including purchasing of the license)
  
#How To:

*Sort*

Sorting is a premium feature designed to hold a longer pay period, and is easier to transfer information. The Basic or Free License will not allow sorting - Ideal for small businesses or not having many employees. 

To Sort, Login in the Admin area - And choose Sort. Basic user's will recieve a error message. 

*Upgrade to premium*

To Upgrade to premium you will need to first email me usimg a special contact form *Not available yet* 72-hours after confirmed payment you will recieve a email issuing your license. 

Upgrading will only need to be done once.

To Upgrade you need admin privlages on your computer, and you will need to add the file required to setup your Premium account. To do this, add the file in the 'EmployeeTrackData' folder. 

Please remember:

Deleting the File will make the program return to the basic edition - Incuding possible data loss!!

To keep the File securely secret from any employees except trusted eyes. 

Do not open the file - After it is in the 'EmployeeTrackData' Folder. 

The file contains a generated license key. I keep track of these keys, and securely hold on to them. 

*Upgrading to a new Product Version*

No patch updates or general updates will occur, but rather Product Updates. Updates are free of charge no matter what, but Premium user's will have a easier time transferring. 

Basic Users will have to re-start from scratch. 


*Data Kept in Employee Track*

There is no Validation method to employee data, so it is important to use something like excel to keep track of your data - a export to excel or like program is given for both Basic and premium license holders.
