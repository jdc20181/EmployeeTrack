# EmployeeTrack
Manage how many hours a employee works easily - 

EmployeeTrack is my first Software Project that will offer a Free & Premium Version, the Free Version will be hosted right here, and is open source. Since its all in one, the license you agree to will differ if you upgrade. Upgrading is done via in Application with a special Code. 

Everything you need to know is in the [usermanual Folder](https://github.com/jdc20181/EmployeeTrack/tree/master/usermanual)

#How it works

The Basic working of this program is to track employees by name, and record clock in and out times. (Tracked by ID Numbers - Requires Seperate program to track employees and their ID's Premium license allows you to do it from the app)

The Premium Features require less work, and bring a powerful integration into your business. 

Pricing is easy. It is a one-Time non refundable Fee of $299  - Premium gives you special Tech suppport, and dedicated assitance in helping with the setup, including remote support! 

There is no updates! I will make sure it is bug free, before shipping it. When new versions are available you can download them, but without hte premium version all data will be lost. 

#Coming soon!

This project is in development, and it may be a while. But if you want the pricing to be guaranteed, as it could change, then you can [contact](mailto:jdc20181@gmail.com) me. In Subject line put Coming Soon Offer
